Database Design and Implementation: (School Course Schedule)

I have designed and Implemented a School Course Schedule Database as my Database Systems Course Project.

In this project i have implemented Stored Procedures,Triggers,views and indexes. All the Data base design rules are followed and the all the 
tables are normalized to 4th normal form , as normalizing the data to more levels decreases the performance of database , i have stopped
the normalization at 4NF.
